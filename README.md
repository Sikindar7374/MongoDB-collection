# MongoDB-collection
mongo db collection representing a team of players for a sport

For example, maybe I want to query my collection for:

The Player with the most touchdown passes.

The Player with the most rushing yards.

The Player with the least rushing yards.

A list of players sorted from most to fewest field goals made.

The Player with the most number of sacks.

While these examples come nowhere close to using the power of MongoDB, they do show the common types of queries a RESTful api might demand of a MongoDB collection.

THAT WAS THE QUESTION AND EXAMPLE. PROJECT IS DONE!
